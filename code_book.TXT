functions：

match_feature：this function can match the activities with their labels.
y_match ：     this function call the match_feature to replace the content in a file which only has the labels of the activities.
mean_col：     this function can produce the mean of each col in a dataframe, and if the content of a column is all the same, it will not process the data in the column.

datasets：

raw datasets:
train_x ：the content of X_train.txt
train_y ：the content of train_y.txt
train_subject ：the content of train_subject.txt
test_subject ：the content of test_subject.txt
test_x ：the content of test_x.txt
test_y ：the content of test_y.txt
features ：the content of features.txt

processed datasets:
test_y_1: the dataset replace the number in the test_y variables with the activities according to the "activity_labels.txt"
train_y_1: the dataset replace the number in the train_y variables with the activities according to the "activity_labels.txt"
whole_test:the dataset is the combination of the test_subject,test_y,test_y_1, and features. It contains all the data of test subjects in the experiment
whole_train: the dataset is the combination of the train_subject,train_y_1,train_x, and features. It contains all the data of train subjects in the experiment
selected_test: the dataset only contains the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of test subjects.
selected_train: the dataset only contains the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of train subjects.
selected_whole_data: the dataset is generated by merging selected_test dataset and selected_train dataset
answer <- it is the tidy dataset.
